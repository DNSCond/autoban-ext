# Automoderator Ban Extension (u/autoban-ext)

Automoderator Ban Extension is a devvit app that bans users on behalf of automoderator.

to ban a user via automoderator simply write "`!ban user 10 "reason"`" in the automoderator config.

the "`!ban user`" can be in any case and the space is optional.  
the "`10`" is the number of days to ban for, you can also use the word "`permanent`" (case-insensitive) for a permanent ban (0 for permanent also works).

the `"reason"` is the link to your custom message (case-sensitive).

you can append "` remove`" to have u/autoban-ext remove the comment automoderator just made.
it can still be seen in the user's notifications but not by anyone else.

## Ban Message Format

(experimenting)

### Who to allow Banning.

of course u/AutoModerator wont be the only moderator bot in your subreddit,
but automoderator is the bot that cant ban natively.

to have any other person or bot be able to use the commannd i described above.
simply write their username in the subreddit config on the developers.reddit.com site.
